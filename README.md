🚀 First Project Completed! Animated Eye Robot using OLED 128x64 👁🎉

I'm excited to share my first project—a robotic animated eye using an OLED 128x64 display! Before buying the OLED, I first simulated the animation in Proteus to test the logic and ensure smooth operation. I shared a video of this simulation a few days ago!

🔧 Key Features:
✅ Smooth animated eye movement
✅ High contrast visuals with OLED technology
✅ First tested in Proteus simulation before hardware implementation
✅ Controlled via a microcontroller (ESP8266, ESP32, or Arduino)

📚 Libraries Used:
I used the Adafruit SSD1306 and Adafruit GFX libraries to drive the OLED display and create animations.

🔌 Wiring & Connection:

VCC → 3.3V / 5V (Depending on OLED type)

GND → GND

SCL → A5 (Arduino) / D22 (ESP32)

SDA → A4 (Arduino) / D21 (ESP32)


💡 Development Process:
⿡ Simulated the animated eye in Proteus to validate the logic
⿢ Purchased the OLED 128x64 display and connected it to my microcontroller
⿣ Implemented animations using Adafruit libraries for a realistic effect

This project was an amazing experience in display control, animation techniques, and embedded systems. Excited for more robotics and mechatronics projects ahead! 🔥
